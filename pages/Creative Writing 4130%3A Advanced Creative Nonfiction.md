	- Project 1: Reading
	  collapsed:: true
		- At this point in your development as a writer, you should have a pretty good sense of what you should read – and what you should read *next.* So, the list below is not prescriptive; it’s just there so that you can get an idea for what to read if you don’t already have something in mind. Whatever works best for you. Choose any of the books that appeal to you – and, in particular, choose what will _feed your soul_. I will leave it to you to decide what that means.

		- This project is focused on _your responses_ to the reading you have been doing. What has been interesting to you? What has made you think, or feel? And, since you are a unique person, your responses will be unique to you. There are no right answers or secret criteria here. You are not making an argument in this project, not passing along some version of the main points of what you read. No, you are simply reading, absorbing, reflecting, and then writing. In that order. The essence of what you write about in this project is your *reflections* on the reading. Here are some examples of the kinds of things you might reflect upon:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Why did you choose this particular reading?
			- How does this reading make you feel?
			- What metaphors or symbols stand out for you, and why?
			- Does the reading remind you of something inside yourself? What? And how?
			- What does this reading teach you about your life?
			- Why do you react to the reading in the way that you do?
			- What do these reactions tell you about yourself?
			- How might you use the knowledge or insights from your reading to grow as a person or to improve and deepen your relationships with others?
			- These are just examples. They are not intended to be prescriptive or compulsory. You will learn your own thing, in your own way.
			- _Do not write an academic essay!_ If you do, I will send it back and politely ask you to resubmit the reading assignment. No essays. No five-paragraph boilerplate. No thesis statements. No bibliography. No statements to the effect that you “will demonstrate in this essay”, or that “further, this shows that”, or “in conclusion.” Nope. You have probably learned to write slightly different versions of the exact same essay, over and over again, in your educational journey. If that’s the case, then this assignment will perhaps be anxiety-provoking. I’m asking you to abandon a particular writing skill – traditional essay-writing – and instead try something that might be completely new.
			- What to write _instead_ of an academic essay? If you’ve been reading books for this class, you will have noticed that you don’t see a lot of essay writing in these readings. You don’t see thesis statements and concluding paragraphs and weasely academic language. Instead, what you see is _storytelling_. Good writing tells a story – fictional or nonfictional or some strange blend. And the stories we are most drawn to? What do they do? They teach us about ourselves. That’s why we’re drawn to them.
			- Don’t summarize your reading, or do a book report, or an essay based on what you think I want to hear. This assignment is about _you_ – and your reactions to what you read, and how those reactions percolate around inside you until you know just a bit more about yourself and the world. This is a complex, deep, and somewhat mysterious process that sometimes goes by the name _creativity_.
			- This is a straightforward project. And yet, many people struggle with it because I am not telling you exactly what to do. Instead, I am suggesting a direction you might go (reading) and I am encouraging you to follow it wherever it may lead. I don’t know where it will lead; neither do you. In the study of creativity, there’s a hifalutin’ word for this process: the _liminal space_, or _liminal zone_. Or _liminality_. The area of uncertainty, ambiguity, and perhaps even disorientation. The place of edges and peering over them. The description of this project is _supposed to be vague_. That’s the point. All the projects in this class are going to be like this. It’s your path, your creative journey. You need to follow it (or not) to where it takes you.
			- How long should this project be? Good question. How long do you think? If you spend some time reading, and you learn something really interesting – maybe about yourself, or your relationship with the world – how many words would it take you to write down your reflections about what you’ve learned and what they mean? More than a hundred? For sure. Five hundred? More, probably. More than a thousand? Probably. Ten thousand? Maybe not that much. See how it goes.
			- I receive a lot of projects that are 1004 words long, or 1002, 1008, or 1033. You get the idea: just over the edge of what I’ve specified as the minimum. Please don’t do that. Write until you’ve reached the point that you’ve said all you need to say. It’s impossible to specify in advance how long that should be – and equally impossible to do it well the night before it’s due. If you rush through this assignment, writing madly at 88 miles per hour to get it submitted before the clock tower signals 10:04 and you’re outta time (you get that pop culture reference, right?), then you will probably not be happy with the result. Instead, take your time. Write this assignment over the course of a week or two, in several shorter writing sessions of maybe an hour each. That should do it.
			- Storytelling – whether you are writing about your life, or your readings, or the [maintenance you do on your motorcycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance) – is as varied as writers. The more of them that you read (writers as well as stories), the more you will get glimpses of what you could do. It won’t help for me to specify in great detail what the form of your project should be. The more formulaic this project is, the less creative you will be. Your job is to think about how you might create something on your own, and do it. This might be very hard. _Try_ hard – and try not to spend time figuring out what I might want. This assignment is not for me; it’s your creativity, and it’s for _you_. Remember this if you can.
			- If you get stuck with this assignment, feel free to reach out to ask questions. But really, getting stuck is part of the process. Getting _unstuck_ is how you activate your creativity.
			- The reading project is **worth 30 percent** of your grade and is provisionally due at the end of week 4. See the section on ((630d2389-ff42-4d65-8517-9ecb43db9965)) for more details.
			- The evaluation criteria used for this project (and for every project) are shown in the section on ((630d2389-6f2d-43fc-b3ef-411ca95b9f69)).
	- Project 2: Writing
	  collapsed:: true
		- Writing projects look different to different people. Beyond the basic course theme (nonfiction)and the project criteria (see the Assessment and Evaluation section for more details), there is no prescribed requirement for what the writing project looks like for you. I’ll let you decide that. Some people will write poetry; some will write magical realism; some will write traditional nonfiction, and so on. Distinctions between genres or notions about word count are not particularly useful. What should be of interest here is _depth_: how deep can you go in your own creative process? That’s a good guideline for a significant writing project: it’s deep, interesting, purposeful, and meaningful – to you.
		- The practical function of this project is to enable you to share your work with the instructor, whose primary interest is in helping you to develop your skill as a writer, to deepen that process of creative engagement, and to facilitate your further development as a creative person. Your particular process is unique to you.
		- It’s interesting to note that many creative people who complete traditional academic degrees say that their academic degree made them _less_ creative. It’s a common refrain in the Arts. Completing a degree can somehow be damaging and somewhat corrosive to the creative process. Quite a bit of research has demonstrated this to be the case. In general, traditional and mainstream academic projects reduce rather than enhance our creativity. However, we are _not_ in a mainstream learning environment; instead, we try to cultivate a learning environment focused on creating rewarding projects. So, your writing project should be something that you’re passionate about, that deeply engages you creatively, and that makes you feel good about your creative practice. That's the goal.
		- If you get stuck, or if you want help, or if you want feedback: reach out to the instructor as often as you like. Creativity is a mysterious, interesting, endlessly fascinating subject. It has all kinds of twists and turns. Follow your own path and see where it takes you.
		- How long should it be? Good question. How long do you think? How many words would represent significant _depth_ for this project? More than a thousand? For sure. Two thousand? More, probably. More than ten thousand? Maybe not that much. See how it goes.
		- Please do not be concerned about genres; the distinctions between literary genres are entirely arbitrary and do not have any real meaning. Fictional narratives are inspired by the real world, and nonfictional narratives always contain fictional elements (as memory is informed by the imagination). Poetic narratives can be prose-like, and prose can be poetic. Mythic narratives are probably the best examples of narratives that are both fictional and nonfictional at the same time. They are both false and true, and much of their power derives from this seamless contradiction. Don’t worry about these details. Just write.
		- Double spaced? Single-spaced? Written with a chisel on a stone tablet? Up to you.
		- The writing project is **worth 30 percent** of your grade and is provisionally due at the end of week 8. See the section on ((630d2389-ff42-4d65-8517-9ecb43db9965)) for more details.
		- The evaluation criteria used for this project (and for every project) are shown in the section on ((630d2389-6f2d-43fc-b3ef-411ca95b9f69)).
