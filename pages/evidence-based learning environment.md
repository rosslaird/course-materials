- This class might be different from what you are used to. It might be very unfamiliar, strange even. But here’s the deal: traditional educational approaches make you worse at creativity. Students who do well in traditional academia – with its predetermined outcomes and quizzes and exams – tend to be less creative overall. That’s what the research shows ([there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfKMq-rYtnc) is [a lot](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201604/inverse-relationship-between-gpa-and-innovative-orientation) of this kind of [research](https://theconversation.com/straight-a-students-may-not-be-the-best-innovators-54440)). You may find that surprising (if you like school) or not (if you hate school). But there’s no doubt that most of the approaches of contemporary, mainstream, western education **reduce** our creative capacities. Sure, those mainstream approaches teach us to become very skilled at figuring out what the teacher wants and handing it right back. The teacher downloads a bunch of content into your mind, then you upload it into the essay or the exam. That’s a skill for sure, and it typically leads to good grades.
	- But creativity is different. Creativity has to come from **you** – from your engagement with your inner life, your emotions, your imagination. Creativity is a deep well of images, memories, words, symbols, ideas, and many other things that float around inside of you. Writing is how we get it out, into the world. But that process has to start with you, not the instructor.
	- So, in this class, you will be asked to do things that shift the focus away from the instructor and toward you: what do you think, feel, and imagine? What stories do you want to tell? What is the best path inward for you? What does your creativity look like? How might you share it?
	- What’s true of those who are temperamentally suited to creative pursuits is also true of everyone else: creativity is a set of skills. We tend to embrace those skills most fully as children and then lose them as adults. Yet we can always learn (or re-learn) and deepen those skills. In this course, we focus on these creative skills as the foundation for our experiences with one another. And we itemize them as features of an integrative and holistic learning environment:

	- {{embed ((630d2389-c7d1-4e3e-b94d-fb793be27331))}}
	-
	- Each item on the above list is an aspect of the first item: self-awareness. The most foundational skill in creativity is self-awareness. Those who develop this skill consistently query their own responses, thoughts, and feelings. They ask themselves:
		- What am I feeling right now?
		- What am I thinking right now?
		- Why am I reacting in this particular way?
		- What do my thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me about myself?
		- Is there anything about my current behavior that suggests unresolved themes in my life?
		- Is my perception of myself consistent with what other people tell me about the kind of person I am?
		- When and how do I get stuck, and what am I doing to work on this?
		- In what ways do I get overwhelmed, or shut down, or avoid?
		- How can I use my insights about myself to grow as a person and to improve and deepen my relationships with others?

	  There is, I think, no point in the philosophy of progressive education which is sounder than its emphasis upon the importance of the participation of the learner in the formation of the purposes which direct their activities in the learning process.
