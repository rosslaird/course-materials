- This class might be different from what you are used to. It might be very unfamiliar, strange even. But here’s the deal: traditional educational approaches make you worse at creativity. Students who do well in traditional academia – with its predetermined outcomes and quizzes and exams – tend to be less creative overall. That’s what the research shows ([there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfKMq-rYtnc) is [a lot](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201604/inverse-relationship-between-gpa-and-innovative-orientation) of this kind of [research](https://theconversation.com/straight-a-students-may-not-be-the-best-innovators-54440)). You may find that surprising (if you like school) or not (if you hate school). But there’s no doubt that most of the approaches of contemporary, mainstream, western education **reduce** our creative capacities. Sure, those mainstream approaches teach us to become very skilled at figuring out what the teacher wants and handing it right back. The teacher downloads a bunch of content into your mind, then you upload it into the essay or the exam. That’s a skill for sure, and it typically leads to good grades.
	- But creativity is different. Creativity has to come from **you** – from your engagement with your inner life, your emotions, your imagination. Creativity is a deep well of images, memories, words, symbols, ideas, and many other things that float around inside of you. Writing is how we get it out, into the world. But that process has to start with you, not the instructor.
	- So, in this class, I am going to ask you to do things that shift the focus away from me and toward you: what do you think, feel, and imagine? What stories do you want to tell? What is the best path inward for you? What does your creativity look like? How might you share it?
	- I can’t answer any of these questions. Your job, in the course, is to start to answer a few of them.

	  Creative thinking is more cognitively demanding than logical thinking. It engages more parts of the brain across the left and right hemisphere and places higher demands on working memory. In that sense, creative thinking is a higher-order skill. In practical terms, this means that analyzing an idea is easier than synthesizing a new one from multiple sources.
	- It’s easy to identify those who possess exemplary creative skills. They tend to be be boundary crossers, skeptics, contrarians. They tend not to like hierarchial structures (such as school), rules, and traditions. Often they can be loners or members of various social groups without fixed allegiance to any single group. They tend to be introspective — because creativity and the inner life are deeply connected. At the same time, many creative people also exhibit skills that we assign to the social sphere: personal warmth, consideration of others, hesitancy to judge, sensitivity to emotions.
	- But what’s true of those who are tempermentally suited to creative pursuits is also true of everyone else: creativity is a set of skills. We tend to embrace those skills most fully as children and then lose them as adults. Yet we can always learn (or re-learn) and depeen those skills. In our course we focus on these creative skills as the foundation for our experiences with one another. And we itemize them as features along the continuum of self-awareness:
		- Commitment to the development of self-awareness
		- Openness to interpersonal process
		- Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure
		- Consideration of and responsiveness to others
		- Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the course
		- Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments
		- Ability to take personal responsibility for learning
		- Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise
		- Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback
	- Each item on the above list is an aspect of the first item: self-awareness. The most foundational skill in creativity is self-awareness. Those who develop this skill consistently query their own responses, thoughts, and feelings. They ask themselves:
		- What am I feeling right now?
		- What am I thinking right now?
		- Why am I reacting in this particular way?
		- What do my thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me about myself?
		- Is there anything about my current behavior that suggests unresolved themes in my life?
		- Is my perception of myself consistent with what other people tell me about the kind of person I am?
		- When and how do I get stuck, and what am I doing to work on this?
		- In what ways do I get overwhelmed, or shut down, or avoid?
		- How can I use my insights about myself to grow as a person and to improve and deepen my relationships with others?

	  There is, I think, no point in the philosophy of progressive education which is sounder than its emphasis upon the importance of the participation of the learner in the formation of the purposes which direct their activities in the learning process.
