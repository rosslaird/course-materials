- Asking for Help
	- You can ask for help anytime. Generally, people learn more deeply when they figure things out in their own ways â€” but everyone has a limit beyond which they just get frustrated and unproductive. A little bit of frustration is good; overwhelm is not. So, give things a try before you ask for help. But if you've been working on something for a long while and you aren't making any progress, [reach out](mailto:ross.laird@kpu.ca).
