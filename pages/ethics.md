- Ethical action – and the development of ethical action – is one of the most important obligations of a human being. Ethics make the world work. Ethics make relationships work. Ethics apply to everything we do and everything around us. And yet, we don’t talk about ethics much. We should. As a creative person – as __any__ kind of person – ethics should be a primary consideration in our development and behaviour. Writers in particular often have voices that carry; we should think about what this means and how to be responsible about it. So, one aspect of skill development for writers must involve ethics. In the section that follows, I’ve provided my own code of ethics. Take a look, see what interests (or challenges) you, and ask yourself what you would write that would represent your own ethical framework. There are no universal answers to the questions of ethics. Everyone has a unique perspective. But you should, at least, have a perspective.
